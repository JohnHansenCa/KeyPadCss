# KeyPadCss
CSS to generate keypads for calculator applications.

[Demo-Note: Adjust the window size to see the effect on the calculator buttons.](https://johnhansenca.github.io/KeyPadCss/)
## About This Project
The goal was to generate a keypad for a [larger calculator](https://github.com/JohnHansenCa/CalculatorJs) project that uses [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/). KeypadCss takes advantage of HTML5/CSS3 technologies. A further project, [KeyPadjs](https://johnhansenca.github.io/KeyPadJs), wraps KeypadCss with javascript to support cascading dropdown lists, popups, sliders and dynamic creations of keys.
# Technical details
to be added
# Using KeypadCss
At this time it is recommended that developers simply 'clone and own' this code.
## Thanks to these projects
-[Github:loup-brun/buttons](https://github.com/loup-brun/buttons)
 > Lots of inspiration from this project.

 > FastActive allows a stylus on a touch device to properly invoke the CSS :active pseudo-class. In other words, without this tiny Javascript module the click animation of buttons doesn't work when using a stylus.
