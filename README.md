# KeyPadCss
Css to generate keypads for calculator applications.

[Demo-Note adjust the window size](https://johnhansenca.github.io/KeyPadCss/)
## About This Project
The goal was to generate a keypad for a larger calculator project that will use [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/). KeypadCss takes advantage of HTML5/CSS3 technologies. A futher project(to be released shortly) will wrap KeypadCss with javascript to support cascading dropdown lists, popups and dynamic creations of keys.
# Technical details
to be added
# Using KeypadCss
At this time it is recommended that developers simply 'clone and own' this code.
# Issues
The font size of the calculator buttons do not scale. A small piece of javascript code will added to fix this problem. Note: In mobile apps the font size can simply be set 'vw' as the calculator width is the window width.
## Thanks to these projects

 > Lots of inspiration from this project.

 > FastActive allows a stylus on a touch device to properly invoke the CSS :active pseudo-class. In other words, without this tiny Javascript module the click animation of buttons doesn't work when using a stylus.
