# KeyPadCss
Css to generate keypads for calculator applications.

[Demo-Note adjust the window size to see the affect on the calculator buttons.](https://johnhansenca.github.io/KeyPadCss/)
## About This Project
The goal was to generate a keypad for a larger calculator project that will use [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/). KeypadCss takes advantage of HTML5/CSS3 technologies. A futher project(to be released shortly) will wrap KeypadCss with javascript to support cascading dropdown lists, popups and dynamic creations of keys.
# Technical details
to be added
# Using KeypadCss
At this time it is recommended that developers simply 'clone and own' this code.
## Thanks to these projects
-[Github:loup-brun/buttons](https://github.com/loup-brun/buttons)
 > Lots of inspiration from this project.

 > FastActive allows a stylus on a touch device to properly invoke the CSS :active pseudo-class. In other words, without this tiny Javascript module the click animation of buttons doesn't work when using a stylus.
